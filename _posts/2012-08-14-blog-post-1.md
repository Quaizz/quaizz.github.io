In this article, I shall introduce the structure of an effective strategy for stock selection. Upon completion, readers will gain insights into its essence.



Step 1: Acquisition of Data:
======


In the realm of quantitative investment, the cornerstone of productivity is the acquisition of high-caliber data. The absence of such data renders even the most profound insights futile. In the United States, stock data acquisition can be prohibitively expensive, with platforms such as Yahoo Finance typically offering only daily price and volume information. This level of data is inadequate for thorough analysis, which necessitates comprehensive financial statement data, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.

Fortunately, the Chinese stock market offers a more economical alternative for obtaining daily data, encompassing price, volume, and detailed financial statements. This accessibility significantly enhances the feasibility of our investment strategies.

The data we utilize is structured in a data frame format, with dimensions of 5000 by 50, extracted from a database. Within this matrix, each row corresponds to an individual stock, while each column denotes a specific factor. These factors, which include Return on Equity (ROE), revenue growth rate, 5-day average price, market capitalization, and debt-to-asset ratio, can be readily derived or computed through sophisticated machine-learning techniques. Regardless of the data source, our analytical process invariably commences with such a data frame, setting the stage for the subsequent stages of our strategy.

Step 2: Calculate the Scores
======

The essence of our stock selection strategy lies in identifying profitable stocks. The crux of this process involves utilizing raw financial metrics to formulate composite scores for each stock. The underlying principle is that stocks with higher scores are deemed to be of superior quality. Thus, our investment focus should be on these high-scoring stocks, while those with lower scores are considered less desirable.

To illustrate the method of score synthesis, consider an example involving three stocks and three financial metrics: Return on Equity (ROE), the inverse of the price-to-book (P/B) ratio, and the Revenue Growth Rate. The data for these metrics is as follows:

| Stock | ROE | 1/pb ratio | Revenue Growth Rate|
|:--------|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| A  | 15%   |  0.02  | 7%|
|B  | 12%   | 0.15  | 50%|
| C   | 8%   | 0.1  |-10%|
|=============================|


Based on the common sence, for each metric, a higher value correlates with a higher stock quality. We achieve uniformity in measurement across disparate metrics by ranking them. This ranking process allows us to standardize the evaluation of each factor, regardless of its inherent scale or unit.

By aggregating these ranks, we derive a comprehensive score for each stock, offering a holistic assessment of its potential. Here is the way about generating the scores.

| Stock | Rank.ROE | Rank.1/pb ratio | Rank.Revenue Growth Rate|Score|
|:--------|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| A  | 3   |  2  | 2|7=3+2+2|
|B  | 2   | 3  | 3|8=2+3+3|
| C   | 1   | 1  |1|3=1+1+1|
|=============================|

The score indicates that B>A>C.
