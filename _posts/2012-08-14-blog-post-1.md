In this article, I shall introduce the structure of an effective strategy for stock selection. Upon completion, readers will gain insights into its essence.



Step 1: Acquisition of Data:
======


In the realm of quantitative investment, the cornerstone of productivity is the acquisition of high-caliber data. The absence of such data renders even the most profound insights futile. In the United States, stock data acquisition can be prohibitively expensive, with platforms such as Yahoo Finance typically offering only daily price and volume information. This level of data is inadequate for thorough analysis, which necessitates comprehensive financial statement data, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.

Fortunately, the Chinese stock market offers a more economical alternative for obtaining daily data, encompassing price, volume, and detailed financial statements. This accessibility significantly enhances the feasibility of our investment strategies.

The data we utilize is structured in a data frame format, with dimensions of 5000 by 50, extracted from a database. Within this matrix, each row corresponds to an individual stock, while each column denotes a specific factor. These factors, which include Return on Equity (ROE), revenue growth rate, 5-day average price, market capitalization, and debt-to-asset ratio, can be readily derived or computed through sophisticated machine-learning techniques. Regardless of the data source, our analytical process invariably commences with such a data frame, setting the stage for the subsequent stages of our strategy.
