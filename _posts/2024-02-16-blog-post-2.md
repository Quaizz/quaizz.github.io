In this article, I shall introduce the evaluation of factors in the stock selection strategy.


Information Coefficient:
=======

The IC (Information Coefficient) value of a factor refers to the correlation coefficient between the factor's exposure vector in period T and the stock return vector in period T+1, denoted as:


$$IC_T = corr(r_{T+1}, X_T )$$


In the formula, the factor exposure vector \\(X_T\\) typically does not directly use the original factor values but is processed through methods like de-extreming and neutralization. In practical calculations, the Pearson correlation coefficient might be significantly affected by extreme values of the factor, making the Spearman rank correlation coefficient a more robust alternative. The IC calculated this way is generally referred to as Rank IC.

When examining a factor, we can calculate and compute the average of the IC in different time. 

$$ \sum_{t=T-n}^{T-1}IC_t$$

Typically, \\(n\\) can be 10 or 20.


When evaluating a factor's performance, it's important to look at the average Information Coefficient (IC) or Rank IC because these figures give us an idea of how well a factor can predict future returns. A high Rank IC value means the factor is a strong predictor and would be a key consideration in our models. However, it's also important not to overlook factors with decent, though not top-ranking, IC values. Financial data is extremely valuable, and we should aim to use it as effectively as possible.

The IC is like a focused measure of predictability, similar to a point estimator in statistics. But just like in statistics, where we use more than one estimator to get a full picture, we need to look beyond just the IC to fully understand a factor's performance. The next method I'll talk about is simple, but it helps give us a broader view of how factors perform.
